# My-To-Do-App

This task has lots of hover effects in order to see it I recommend you 1st hover over the name, plus button and the trash button.
In the task list hover over few things there as well.
Due to that I couldnt really find how to add the sort() method it regret to send it in like that.
If you press the "Add Task" button and there is nothing in the input there will display an alert.
The due date I was trying to add that with the task but it was little hard to link it so it display as well.
If you have completed an task and click on it, it will execute an innnerHTML.
If you click on the complete button it will execute the innerHTML.
If you double click on the div it will execute something else.
